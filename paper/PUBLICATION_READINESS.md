# Publication readiness audit

Audit date: 2026-08-15

Publication status: NOT_READY

Required scientific blockers: strong SIC calibration baselines,
spatial/physical preservation, clean checkpoint and frozen independent
evaluation

## Scientific readiness decision

The validation-set mechanism result and completed joint calibration audit are
internally auditable, but this is not a
submission-ready strong domain/SciML paper. Narrowing the claim to one global
spread correction does not satisfy the minimum tier frozen in
`paper/RESEARCH_PLAN.md`. The earlier readiness decision is withdrawn.

The evidence supports a useful mechanism diagnosis: the learned-joint
ten-member ensemble is globally underdispersed and cross-fitted anomaly scaling
improves fair CRPS without moving the pre-clipping center. The completed audit
rejects spatial preservation. Paired date uncertainty now supports the fair-CRPS
improvement, and the post-hoc four-date-block sensitivity agrees; comparison
with strong SIC postprocessors and independent generalization remain absent.

The global scaling is therefore frozen only as a reproducible reference
and negative mechanism baseline, not as the selected calibrated-ensemble
method. The joint stop/go gate has been applied: proper scores improve, but
boundary and spatial/physical preservation fail. Established-ice Brier score
worsens by 2.15%, exact-one member mass rises to 0.164832 despite zero truth
mass, mean IIEE worsens by 5.50%, and edge disagreement worsens by 4.41%.

## Minimum-tier gap audit

| Required element | Current evidence | Readiness consequence |
|---|---|---|
| Clean checkpoint and frozen independent evaluation | One legacy checkpoint and reused development dates | Blocking; method may be frozen, but the generalization claim is not tested |
| Exact deterministic comparison | Background and learned-joint aggregate RMSE/IIEE are available; no independent frozen comparison is claimed | Blocking for the main comparison table |
| Correct finite-ensemble diagnostics | Fair and ordinary CRPS, spread-skill, four coverage diagnostics and center invariance are reported | Satisfied for the narrow mechanism claim |
| Strong SIC calibration baselines | Raw, affine-logit, global spread, and a fixed purged hurdle-isotonic/ECC-Q comparator are evaluated; all postprocessors fail at least one mandatory family | Partially resolved: a boundary-aware rank-preserving comparator now exists as a strong negative ablation, but one failed fixed construction does not complete the minimum baseline tier |
| Case/block uncertainty | Trusted 40-date paired analysis reports fair-CRPS delta `-0.00280091`, date CI `[-0.00413219, -0.00135419]`, and circular four-date-block CI `[-0.00502644, -0.000290285]`; ordinary-CRPS intervals cross zero | Satisfied for the narrow mechanism claim; the block interval is a post-hoc temporal sensitivity, not a predeclared pass/fail gate |
| Spatial/physical preservation | The joint audit reports calibrated IIEE, edge, area/extent and variogram diagnostics; the candidate exceeds the IIEE and edge tolerances | Blocking for selection of global scaling, but resolved as an auditable negative mechanism result |
| Publication figures | A reproducible aggregate mechanism figure and manuscript uncertainty table are cited; spatial/physical diagnostics are tabulated | Partial; a claim-led spatial/physical figure is still desirable but no longer blocks truthful reporting of the compact evidence |
| References and reproducibility | Core scoring and generative-model references plus a guarded reconciliation contract are present | Partial; baseline and sea-ice verification references must accompany the missing experiments |

## Fastest defensible next evidence

The completed joint audit rejects global anomaly scaling under the frozen gate,
and the trusted CPU result closes paired uncertainty without new sampling. The
fixed purged hurdle-isotonic bounded distribution with ECC-Q now supplies the
previously missing boundary-aware/rank-preserving mechanism comparison. It
repairs boundary masses and randomized ranks but fails proper-score and
spatial/physical families by large margins. The remaining minimum-tier gap is
therefore broader independent baseline coverage and a candidate that can
satisfy the no-compensation gate, not another tuning point. No additional
implemented mode supplies a mechanistically distinct eligible family.
Repeating completed analyses would not change the decision.

## Safe autonomous work completed or still possible

- The frozen method, aggregate reconciliation values, clipping caveat and
  negative affine-logit finding are recorded consistently.
- Paired intervals and improved-case counts are cited only from the completed
  trusted compact analysis, never reconstructed from aggregate means.
- The completed joint-audit schema is now distinguished from the earlier
  spread-only schema: its 160 long-form rows contain `target_date` and `method`
  for four methods. The completed trusted server analysis uses this contract;
  its compact intervals are cited without copying the case table into the
  publication worktree.
- The guarded artifact generator now accepts the completed 160-row long-form
  contract directly. It pivots exactly named methods by unique ISO
  `target_date`, requires both methods on all 40 dates and the predeclared
  four-case block length, and emits paired case-bootstrap and circular-block
  intervals only after proper-score, boundary and spatial means reproduce the
  trusted aggregate anchors within `1e-10`. Malformed dates, duplicate pairs,
  incomplete method pairs and provenance mismatches fail closed.
- The claim ledger, manuscript and readiness audit now record the failed joint
  gate and its boundary/spatial mechanism without accessing raw ensembles.
- The fixed purged hurdle-isotonic/ECC-Q result is recorded as a negative
  mechanism ablation: boundary-mass and rank diagnostics improve, while paired
  proper-score, IIEE, edge and energy diagnostics reject method selection.
- The manuscript evidence table reports the boundary and spatial failures next
  to the proper-score gains, including the improving lag-1/lag-2 variogram
  errors that are explicitly barred from compensating for failed mandatory
  families. This prevents the aggregate reliability figure from being read as
  the complete scientific decision.
- A fail-closed generator for the aggregate CRPS, spread-skill and coverage
  figure is present and documented; it uses only the trusted one-row summary
  and does not imply paired uncertainty or spatial preservation.

## External boundary

The joint gate decision is complete: global spread scaling is rejected as the
paper's calibrated-ensemble method. The immediate external scientific boundary
is specification and review of a mechanistically distinct strong-baseline
contract or authorization of the already frozen independent evaluation; the
available fixed boundary/rank comparator has been completed and rejected.
The paired date/block CPU analysis of the existing compact audit is complete;
its compact result has been reconciled into the evidence chain, while local
reconstruction remains intentionally excluded. The currently implemented modes
cannot supply another independent strong baseline family beyond the completed
negative comparators. The frozen independent evaluation
also remains locked until explicit authorization after the pre-test evidence
package and clean checkpoint are complete.
